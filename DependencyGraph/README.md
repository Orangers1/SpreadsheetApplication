## Contents

It is a dependency graph with methods that help define how any two "variables" (in a spreadsheet)
are related, in the dependent/dependee sense, and getter/setter methods relating to that.

## references

In class, Prof De St. Germain said we should use a two-dictionary structure, so I did.
I asked chatGPT about IEnumerables and what things implement that interface. 

## consulted peers

NA

## time estimates and actuals

I estimate this will take around 16 hours.
Ideally:
4 hours coding
8 hours debugging
4 hours learning tools and techniques

9/11 first coding session
Note: after one 4 hour session my code is passing all opaque tests
I spent 30 minutes debugging
3hr 30 min coding

9/12 second coding session
I spent 1.5 hours debugging, code is now passing stress test provided by instructors.

9/13
small code edits, mostly formatting and comments. .5 hrs.

total: 6 hrs, expected 16 hours.
