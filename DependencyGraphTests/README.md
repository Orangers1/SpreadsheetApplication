## Contents

Test the functionality of the DependencyGraph project,
using:
stress tests
opaque tests
transparent tests

## time estimates and actuals

I expect this to take 4 hours to write and debug any tests,
1 hour for opaque tests and stress test
3 hours for transparent tests

9/10: Opaque tests finished 1hr 30min

9/12: Adding all transparent tests and stress test 3 hrs

9/13: Finish final stress test, fix comments, 1 hr

total: 5.5 hrs, expected 4 hours

## notes

9/17 spend 5 hrs debugging once grader tests released
